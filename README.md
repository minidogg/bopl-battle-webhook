# Bopl Battle Webhook
Webhook thing for Bopl Battle

# How to Host (WIP documentation)
There are 2 methods to host the webhook. You can either use the Node.js version or the Google Sheets version. I prefer using the Google Sheets version because it is free hosting that runs 24/7.

## Node.js
You will need at least version 21 of Node.js.
